# duolingo_flashcards
### a website which creates 20 random flashcards from duolingo vocabulary 
-------------


##### Usage

[Duolingo api](https://github.com/KartikTalwar/Duolingo) is used here, and it refuses to work without logging in, so the first thing to do is to enter username (not email) and password.
Next you'll be asked to chose your target language, then 20 or less flashcards are generated and shown. Note that the flashcard backside is also generated with help of duolingo, and at this point it seems a litte odd (in many not-very-popular languages it returns no data). I'll probably switch to google translate. 
Then practice begins. Think of flashcard translation and click on it (= press space), and then decide if your guess was right or not. If it wasn't, you'll see this card one more time for better memorizing.
