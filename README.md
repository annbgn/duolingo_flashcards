##### Usage

[Duolingo api](https://github.com/KartikTalwar/Duolingo) is used here, and it refuses to work without logging in, so the first thing to do is to enter username (not email) and password.

Next you'll be asked to chose your target language, then 20 or less flashcards are generated and shown. Note that the flashcard backside is  generated with help of mymemory, and it may not correspond with duolingo course. 

Then practice begins. Think of flashcard translation and click on it (= press space), and then decide if your guess was right or not (= arrow keys). If it wasn't, you'll see this card one more time for better memorizing.
